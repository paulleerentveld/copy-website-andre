                    <p>I wanna talk to you! The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears I promise you it won't happen again! Do I attract you? Do I repulse you with my queasy smile? Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty? Do I like what you like? I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome, I guess I'm a little bit shy Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me without making me try?</p>

            <p>I tried to be like Grace Kelly But all her looks were too sad So I tried a little Freddie I've gone identity mad! (Mad, mad, mad!) I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like Gotta be green, gotta be mean, gotta be everything more Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me? Why don't you walk out the door! Getting angry doesn't solve anything!</p>
                
            <p>How can I help it? How can I help it? How can I help what you think? Hello my baby, hello my baby, putting my life on my brink Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me? Why don't you like yourself? Should I bend over, should I look older, just to be put on your shelf? I tried to be like Grace Kelly But all her looks were too sad So I tried a little Freddie I've gone identity mad! (Mad, mad, mad!)</p>
                
            <p>I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like Gotta be green, gotta be mean, gotta be everything more Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me? Walk out the door! Say what you want to satisfy yourself, hey! But you only want what everybody else says you should want You want</p>
